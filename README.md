# Description
I created a Python script to find unknown or invalid words in a text file based on a list of valid words. I created it because I want to create a Tolkien Universe dictionary and the ones I've find are very incomplete or I would have to script a tool that extracts data from some wiki.
The plan is to filter out all the valid English words and create a list with every word that the script finds that is not on that English list and write it into a file to later on add descriptions and create a dictionary. I can see being very helpful for fantasy books, especially ones with lots of characters, places and creatures like The Lord of the Rings, Dune or even Harry Potter.

# Kindle plans
With a list of words and definitions the plan is to create a more complete dictionary I can use in my Kindle. I already managed to create a Kindle dictionary but I kept coming across places and characters with no definition on "A Dictionary of Tolkien" by David Day, so the plan is to find all the character names, places and creatures to add my own descriptions and be able to distribute them
